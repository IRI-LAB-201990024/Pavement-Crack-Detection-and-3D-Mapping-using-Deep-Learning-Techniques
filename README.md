# Pavement-Crack-Detection-and-3D-Mapping-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

Regular inspection and maintenance of roads are required to ensure safe transportation. While examining the state of structural health, cracks are considered as the primary indicators. In the past decades, researchers have been working on various image-based pavement crack detection techniques for non-destructive evaluation. The main advantages of these techniques over manual inspection are accuracy, efficiency and cost. However, the problems associated with the existing methods are their dependence on the handcrafted features, which may not give accurate results due to insufficient feature selection. In this paper, an automatic image-based crack detection algorithm for pavement crack detection using deep learning techniques is proposed. The data set was obtained from various road surfaces of United Arab Emirates (UAE) by using an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and was used in training and validation of the proposed system. The collected data was also used to create a composite view of the road by creating a continuous mosaic using an image-based 3D photogrammetry technique.The map is then projected onto the 3D model to allow cracks to be located in the 3D world.


## Database
Currently UAVs are considered as the most precious tool for inspection of various civil infrastructures. Drones are used by inspectors to collect high resolution data from
the sites in a timely manner. In this paper, UAV is used for data collection from a road surface in United Arab Emirates as shown in Fig. 1. The data is collected by using the sweeping strategy in order to create mosaic image of the road.
